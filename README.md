# Users

## Prerequisites
Users need to have
1. Basic command-line knowledge
2. Python3.x installed on their machine
3. Credentials to access data in the S3 bucket (access and secret keys)

## Install
Get `hca-util` from PyPi.

```shell script
$ pip install hca-util
```
                           
## Usage

Display help

```shell script
$ hca-util -h
usage: hca-util [-h] [--profile PROFILE]
                   {config,create,select,dir,clear,list,upload,download,delete}
```

In the above, optional arguments are between `[]` and choices between `{}`.

The basic usage is as follows:

```shell script
$ hca-util cmd ARG1 ARG2 -o1 -o2
```

Use the tool by specifying a command (`cmd` - see list below) to run, any mandatory (positional) arguments (e.g. `ARG1` and `ARG2` - see positional args for each command), and any optional arguments (e.g. `-o1` and `o2` - see options for each command).

## List of commands

help for a specific command:

```shell script
$ hca-util <command> -h
```

Some commands or options/flags are restricted to authorised users (for e.g. wranglers, admin) only.

## `config` command

Configure AWS credentials

```shell script
$ hca-util config ACCESS_KEY SECRET_KEY

positional arguments:
  ACCESS_KEY         AWS Access Key ID
  SECRET_KEY         AWS Secret Access Key
```

By default, this tool looks for and uses the profile name _hca-util_, if it exists, or it can be set by the `config` command.

Running a command with the `--profile` argument uses the specified profile instead of the default _hca-util_ profile.
